					<h3>WHO WE ARE?</h3>
				</div>
				<p> Haemophilus infl uenzae type b is responsible for many cases
					of childhood pneumonia and middle ear infections, as well as respiratory infections and meningitis. It is now becoming increasingly
					resistant to tetracyclines, ampicillin, and chloramphenicol. Similarly,
					the worldwide rate of penicillin-nonsusceptible (i.e., resistant)
					Streptococcus pneumoniae (PNSP) continues to increase. There is a
					direct correlation between the daily use of antibiotics (expressed as
					defi ned daily dose [DDD] per day) and the percent of PNSP isolates
					cultured ( box fi gure ). This dramatic correlation is alarming. More
					alarming is the continued indiscriminant use of antibiotics in light of
					these data.</p>
				<p> The sale of antimicrobial drugs is big business. In the United States,
					millions of pounds of antibiotics valued at billions of dollars are produced annually. As much as 70% of these antibiotics are added to
					livestock feed.</p>
				<p>Collins French to English and English to French online dictionary is a bespoke text written by experienced French and English language experts using databases of authentic language. This authoritative resource offers language learners everything they need for online lookup from a dictionary they can trust.

					<h3>OUR VISION</h3>
				</div>
				<p>A vision statement is a written declaration clarifying your business’s meaning and purpose for stakeholders, especially employees. It describes the desired long-term results of your company’s efforts. For example, an early Microsoft vision statement was “a computer on every desk and in every home.” 

					“A company vision statement reveals, at the highest levels, what an organization most hopes to be and achieve in the long term,” said Katie Trauth Taylor, owner and CEO of Untold Content, a writing consultancy. “It serves a somewhat lofty purpose – to harness all the company’s foresight into one impactful statement.”</p>
				<p>We’ll explore vision statements and their importance, as well as offer tools and best practices for crafting an inspiring vision statement that powers your growth strategy.  </p>

					<h3>SEAFTY POLICY</h3>
				</div>
				<p>A health and safety policy should be completed by a competent person, this will usually be the individual responsible for health and safety on site. A health and safety policy needs the buy-in in of all stakeholders, particularly the ones who have significant roles and responsibilities for safety on site – this will ensure your policy is accurate and fit for purpose.
				<ul class="about-list">
					<li>Statement of Intent – Sets out the organisations aims and objectives.</li>
					<li>Roles and Responsibilities – Outlines who has specific responsibility for managing health and safety and what they are responsible for.</li>
					<li>In search of an equitable world of work.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>A health and safety policy should be completed by a competent person, this will usually be the individual responsible for health and safety on site. A health and safety policy needs the buy-in in of all stakeholders, particularly the ones who have significant roles and responsibilities for safety on site – this will ensure your policy is accurate and fit for purpose.In many countries it’s a requirement that a health and safety policy is reviewed, and amended if necessary, on an annual basis. IOSH would suggest that an annual review is best practice for most organisations. However, if your organisation undergoes frequent changes, reviewing the policy more regularly is recommended.

					<h3 style="font-size:19px;">PROJECT EXECUTION AND OPERATIONS</h3>
				</div>
				<p>Most of today’s project tools are focused on project scheduling, which is before the project starts, or project accounting, which is mostly after the project ends (at least periodically). There are very few project execution systems. Ironically, this phase is arguably the most important, as it is when the work actually gets done, taking up the largest amount of time in the project life cycle and is when the most issues occur that set the project off track.

					Today, most project execution activities listed above are managed offline, in spreadsheets, word documents and emails. What if there were a system to manage all of that.</p>
				
				<ol class="about-list">
					<li>Project scheduling and planning are simply the beginning. Most of the time and work of a project are during its execution. Therefore, execution in project management is critically important.</li>
					<li>Project Execution is the phase in the project life cycle when the work is performed, and everything in the project plan is put into action.</li>
